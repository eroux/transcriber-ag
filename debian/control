Description: Speech transcription tool
 Transcription tool for assisting the manual annotation of speech
 signals. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)
 for segmenting long duration speech recordings, transcribing them,
 labeling speech turns, topic changes and acoustic conditions.
 .
 TranscriberAG is geared toward the needs of the speech research
 community, but its features might be found useful for other
 applications. It uses the Annotation Graph format as native format
 but can read a number of other annotation formats.
